#  FlightGear-Controller



# Project Description

FlightGear-Controller is an **Android Application** written in Kotlin.
The app allows you to connect to FlightGear running simulator and control the aircraft
using a customize remote joystick.
The application uses the MVVM architecture.
The model uses Active Object design pattern that in charge of sending data 
to the FlightGear server.

## Features

* Connect to FlightGear simulator via ***ip*** and ***port***
* Control the aircraft movement with customize Joystick
* Set the Throttle and Rudder of aircraft using sliders (seekbars)
* Disconnect button whenever you want to terminate the connection and end your flight
* Ending screen where you can decide if you want to go back and fly again.

4. now FlightGear is all set and done waiting for you to connect.
you can change the view of the aircraft by presssing 'V'.
5. Download the source code (zip or git clone).
6. Open the source code with Android studio and run the app with android studio built in emulator
   or an android device you can plug in via usb to PC



# Operating Instructions

After FlightGear talent server is online and the app is running,
the opening screen you will see is the ConnectorFragment where you need to insert IP address and Port
that you configure in setup stage.

click the connect button in order to connect to FG server.
While connected you'll move to the ControllerFragment, that's the screen who contains the joystick controlling the aircraft.

Look up to the setting bar in FlightGear and search for name of the current aircraft ur using, and click Autostart

that should be able to start aircraft's engines.

**!! NOTICE !!**

Keep Throttle Seekbar at 0 when pressing autostart


Move Throttle in order to start aircraft going, and navigate plane using Rudder and the Joystick

Pressing on **Disconnect** button at the end of screen will terminate connection with FlightGear server
and navigate user to the end screen:

## MVVM architecture

In this project we used the MVVM architecture.
The code is defined by 3 main sections:

> Model


The *FGConnector* which is an Kotlin single object  that located in
 *models* directory; is functioning as our model.
 It establishing the connection with server and send it data designed as an Active object with tasks organized in *BlockingQueue*
 
> ViewModel

Next we have different ViewModels such as *ConnectorViewModel* 
and *ControllerViewModel* for each fragment/view in the application
Through data binding and events those view models get info from user and operate the model by inserting task to its task queue and different thread will execute those tasks.
>View

The app contain 3 different views implemented as Fragments:
1. *ConnectorFragment* - opening view of the app, connect the user to the FG server
2. *ControllerFragment* - the view that has the joystick and all the
features that controls the plane flight.
3. *ThankYouFragment* - end screen of the app.
